# **Feature Fusion by Similarity Regression for Logo Retrieval**

+ Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision, 2015

## **1. Introduction**
Logo retrieval is a challenging problem in computer vision, as logos can appear in different scales, orientations, colors, and partial occlusions. Traditional methods rely on single-feature representations such as SIFT, color histograms, or edge descriptors. However, no single feature is robust enough to handle all variations in logo images. 

To improve retrieval accuracy, this paper introduces **Feature Fusion by Similarity Regression**, which learns an optimal combination of multiple features. Instead of simple concatenation or weighted averaging, the method applies **regression-based feature fusion** to enhance logo retrieval performance.

## **2. Overview of the Method**
The proposed approach consists of three key steps:

1. **Feature Extraction**: Extract multiple types of features from each logo image.
2. **Similarity Computation**: Compute similarity scores between two images for each feature type.
3. **Similarity Regression**: Use a regression model to fuse similarity scores into a final retrieval score.

---

## **3. Feature Extraction**
Feature extraction is the process of converting an image into numerical representations that capture key visual characteristics. In this method, three types of features are extracted to ensure robustness:

### **3.1 SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)**
SIFT detects and describes keypoints in an image that are invariant to scale and rotation. It works by:
1. Identifying keypoints using Difference of Gaussians (DoG).
2. Assigning orientations to keypoints based on image gradients.
3. Creating a descriptor by computing histograms of gradient directions around the keypoint.

### **3.2 Color Histograms**
A color histogram represents the distribution of colors in an image by counting the number of pixels of each color.
- It is robust to small changes in scale but sensitive to large color variations.
- Useful when color is a distinguishing feature in logos.

### **3.3 Edge Descriptors (Canny Edge Detection)**
Edge detection helps capture shape and contour information of a logo.
- Canny edge detection applies Gaussian smoothing, finds intensity gradients, and traces object edges.
- Effective for recognizing logos with unique shapes.

### **3.4 Combining Feature Vectors**
After extraction, each logo is represented by a feature vector:

\[
F = [SIFT\_features, Color\_histogram, Edge\_features]
\]

These feature vectors are used in the next step to compute similarity between logo pairs.

Example feature similarity scores:

| Feature | Similarity Score |
|---------|----------------|
| SIFT | \( S_1(I_1, I_2) = 0.8 \) |
| Color Histogram | \( S_2(I_1, I_2) = 0.6 \) |
| Edge Descriptor | \( S_3(I_1, I_2) = 0.7 \) |

---

## **4. Similarity Regression Model**
Instead of manually weighting the features, a **linear regression model** is trained to determine optimal weights for combining feature similarities. The fusion model is defined as:

\[
S(I_1, I_2) = w_1 S_1(I_1, I_2) + w_2 S_2(I_1, I_2) + w_3 S_3(I_1, I_2) + b
\]

Where:
- \( w_1, w_2, w_3 \) are learned weights for each feature similarity.
- \( b \) is a bias term.
- \( S(I_1, I_2) \) is the final similarity score.

After training on labeled pairs of **matching (same logo)** and **non-matching (different logos)** images, the model learns the optimal feature weighting.

---

## **5. Model Training and Error Optimization**
The model is trained using a dataset of logo pairs, with each pair labeled as **1 (same logo)** or **0 (different logos)**. The weights are optimized by minimizing the Mean Squared Error (MSE):

\[
E = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (S(I_i, I_j) - y_{ij})^2
\]

### **Step-by-step Calculation Example**
#### **1. Training Data (Example Set)**
| Image Pair | \( S_1 \) (SIFT) | \( S_2 \) (Color Histogram) | \( S_3 \) (Edge) | True Label \( y \) |
|------------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| Logo A - B | 0.8   | 0.6   | 0.7   | 1    |
| Logo C - D | 0.3   | 0.4   | 0.2   | 0    |

#### **2. Compute Total Error**
\[
E = (0.0225 + 0.01) / 2 = 0.01625
\]

#### **3. Update Weights Using Gradient Descent**
For each weight \( w_k \):
\[
w_k = w_k - \eta \frac{\partial E}{\partial w_k}
\]
where \( \eta \) is the learning rate.

By repeating this process over multiple iterations, the model converges to optimal weights, reducing the prediction error and improving accuracy.

## **6. Logo Retrieval Process**
Given a query logo:
1. Compute feature similarity scores with each image in the database.
2. Use the trained regression model to compute a final similarity score.
3. Rank the images based on similarity and return the top matches.

---

## **7. Conclusion**
- **Similarity Regression** provides an adaptive way to fuse multiple feature types.
- The method improves **logo retrieval accuracy by 10-15%** over traditional feature fusion techniques.
- It is extensible, allowing new feature types to be integrated without manual tuning.

This method provides a robust and scalable solution for **real-world logo retrieval applications**.
